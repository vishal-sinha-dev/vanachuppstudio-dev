Some facial features and hair detail might be slightly different on the final product than what shown on the proof especially when the product undergoes the laser cutting procedure. Metals melt slightly due to the heat released during the laser cutting causing some details like hair, nose and lips to get minimized. This is more visible on the tiny and medium charms as well as the silhouette rings and tiny pendants.<\/p><p><strong>Please note that for our smallest size charms, some of the facial features might be less noticeable and not as clear compared to the actual proof you will receive.<\/strong> The digital proofs are done according to the size of the picture\/s provided with your order. The actual silhouette charms are much smaller. If this is an issue for you, please opt for a larger size charm. We no longer include eyelashes on any of our jewelry pieces. We are happy to answer additional questions regarding sizing, prior to you placing an order.<\/p><p><strong>MATERIALS + CARE<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>14k Solid Gold<\/strong> - We use 14k solid yellow, rose and white gold on our heirloom jewelry so your pieces will last you a lifetime. Unlike plated gold, solid gold will not rub off or alter in appearance over time, is most hypoallergenic and durable for everyday wear. Gold should be cleaned regularly in order to maintain its beauty and luster. It can get dirty though. Like any precious metal, solid gold does scratch, so be mindful. Using the included polishing cloth to clean is highly recommended to ensure the longevity of your pieces.<\/p><p><strong>.925 Sterling Silver<\/strong> - PLEASE NOTE: As of March 1, 2023 we have discontinued Sterling Silver on the majority of our products. You can still add on to your existing Sterling Silver piece through our <a href=\"https:\/\/vanachuppstudio.com\/collections\/add-on-products-services\/products\/add-a-charm-add-on\">Add-A-Charm product<\/a> until July 1, 2023. For more details, please read our post <a href=\"https:\/\/vanachuppstudio.com\/blogs\/blog\/why-we-are-retiring-sterling-silver\">HERE<\/a>. The best way to clean your sterling silver charm or ornament, and to prevent or remove dirt and tarnish, is to use a silver polishing cloth or any anti-tarnish silver polish which can be found at your local supermarket or drugstore. Rub the cloth on the charm until it's shiny again.<\/p><p>If you have any additional questions about this decision, please don't hesitate to reach out at<a href=\"mailto:info@vanachuppstudio.com\">info@vanachuppstudio.com<\/a><\/p><p><strong>Gold Filled<\/strong> - PLEASE NOTE: We have discontinued this metal as of September 9, 2019. For more details please read our post <a href=\"https:\/\/vanachuppstudio.com\/blogs\/blog\/why-are-we-retiring-gold-filled\">HERE<\/a>.<\/p><p><strong>Brass <\/strong>- We use brass on our silhouette and home ornaments. Brass is a base metal and it will tarnish over time receiving a unique patina. This is completely normal. The best way to clean your ornament, and to remove dirt or tarnish is to use a mixture of a teaspoon of lemon juice with a teaspoon of baking soda until it forms a paste like consistency. Salt works great as a substitute to baking soda. Gently rub the mixture over the ornament. Rinse throughout with hot running water and dry immediately with a cotton dish towel. Brass will tarnish quicker than silver and over time obtain a beautiful patina. Please store your ornaments on its original box to ensure they stay beautiful year after year.<\/p>",
